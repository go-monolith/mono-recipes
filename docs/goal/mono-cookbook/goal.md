# Goal

Mono Cookbook

## Vision

Create a curated collection of reusable code recipes, patterns, and examples that serve as a comprehensive reference library for backend development, covering API recipes, event-driven architecture (EDA), and database integration patterns. All examples will be built using the `github.com/go-monolith/mono` framework to demonstrate best practices and common use cases. Also contributing to `mono-development` skill to improve framework best practices and guidelines.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] At least 20 well-documented, quality recipes covering common backend use cases
- [ ] Clear organization with searchable index and logical categorization
- [ ] Each recipe is self-contained with clear prerequisites and dependencies
- [ ] All recipes include working code examples that can be copied and adapted
- [ ] Documentation explains the "why" behind each pattern, not just the "how"

## Context

This cookbook serves as a reference library for developers to quickly find proven solutions to common backend development challenges. It captures institutional knowledge and best practices, reducing the time spent solving recurring problems and ensuring consistent patterns across projects.

## Scope

### In Scope

- API recipes (REST, GraphQL, and other API implementation patterns)
- Event-driven architecture patterns (message queues, async processing)
- Database integration patterns (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, etc.)
- Backend service patterns and best practices

### Out of Scope

- Frontend/UI code (React, Vue, or other frontend frameworks)
- Mobile development (iOS, Android, or mobile-specific patterns)
- Infrastructure/DevOps (Kubernetes, Terraform, CI/CD pipelines)
